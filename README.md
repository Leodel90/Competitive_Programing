# Competitive-Programming

All my solved competitive programming problems through the years, most of them back then in college.

I used to practice mostly with java in [UVA online judge](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/652690), not sure why ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
I did some c++ in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) in recent years, it is nice too.
